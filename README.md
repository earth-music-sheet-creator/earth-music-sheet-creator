# earth-music-sheet-creator

This project is under development and aims to use climatic data to generate music sheets which are specific to the input data.

Currently it can output music sheets for small data sets.

Documentation coming soon.

Docker file will be updated soon for a better implementation.

If you are interested, let me know, you could work on many aspects right now :-)
